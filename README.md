A couple of months ago i repicked up the video game Noita again. Noita is a rougelite game built in a falling sand engine and is one of the most technologically impressive games i've played because every pixel is simulated. I was inspired by this game to create my own falling sand simulation and engine because hey, why not. I choose to implement this project in core JS and HTML because then i can focus on learning the cellular automata rules used in falling sand simulation games. The trade-off is that JS isn't as fast as other languages. My long term goal is to now use what i've learned to implement a falling sand sim in C++ using OpenGL.
